# CS682 Tutorial Session

This project includes material for a tutorial session conducted for the course [CS682 : Neural Networks: A Modern Introduction course](https://compsci682-fa21.github.io/). <br>
The session covered techniques for visualizations and error analysis for simple deep learning models developed in PyTorch or Tensorflow. 
Moreover, it includes a demonstration of using [wandb](https://wandb.ai/site), an MLOps platform.

## Contents
The session was conducted as a collection of .ipynb notebooks and presentation covering model debugging techniques:
1. Debugging Model Inputs - Data Visualization (DataAnalysis.ipynb)
2. Debugging Model Architecture - (Project Tutorial Session.pptx)
3. Debugging Model Outputs - Recording Machine Learning Experiments (WandbDemo.ipynb)
